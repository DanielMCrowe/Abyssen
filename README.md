# Abyssen

**Abyssen** is a top-down 2D pixel art game blending chaotic gameplay with a deeper, dark narrative inspired by *Berserk*, *Made in Abyss*, *Undertale*, and *Celeste*. Multiverse Marvel-level stakes, fourth-wall breaks, and narrative choices that change everything.

## Gameplay

- Starts simple (something like *Forager*) but quickly evolves into chaos  
- Pixel-perfect movement & tight controls  
- Particle effects to amp up the madness  
- Choices impact the multiverse and story paths  
- Dark, existential themes mixed with surreal narrative twists  
- Combat integrated into the main gameplay

## Art & Music

- Pixel art style inspired by *Celeste* and *Undertale*  
- Early versions use tracks from *Undertale*, *Aphex Twin*, and *Willix* (subject to change)
